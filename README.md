## A Full Stack Course

Hi there! I'm learning full stack dev, which means I have to do some learning. I'm taking an online free course, and marking my learnings right here! I highly encourage you to take the course yourself, or just check it out. I'll finish this over the course of a few days!!

<b>Note: I'm not doing this course for the credit/submission - purely for self study. </b>
